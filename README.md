# Heyday

"[Hey Day]" at Auburn University traces its origins back to 1947 when WWII veterans returned to the campus. These returning students felt out of touch on the AU campus. To address this, the Auburn University student body, along with the Student Government Association, spearheaded an initiative to create a day that would foster unity and a welcoming atmosphere. This day was named [Hey Day], and consists of every student wearing name tags which creates an environment where everyone can feel connected to one another. Today, the tradition lives on as we continue to celebrate [Hey Day].  [Hey Day] serves as a reminder of the importance of community and connection within the Auburn family.
